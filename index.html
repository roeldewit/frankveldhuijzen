          After more than 25 years of experience in Interventional Cardiology and Vascular Access I started as a consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started as a nurse in the Catharina hospital in Eindhoven (16 years) and moved in 1995 to Boston Scientific as a Clinical Specialist and later as a Therapeutical Development Specialist.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009 I became the co-owner of Clinical Devices, a distributor for Navilyst, PFM, Dry Pro, SCW and Demax. In 2013 Clinical Devices was sold to Angiodynamics and I started as a consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A highly driven individual who can work under pressure. A team player who always strives to achieve targets and works hard to meet deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a good and varied knowledge of the market and the customers, with a wide experience, clinically and sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          For companies who need skilled people for the introduction of new products or to support clinical studies Iâ€™m the right person.
        </p>
        <p>
